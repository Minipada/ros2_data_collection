# Future Work and Roadmap

DC still being in early development, it requires:
1. High code coverage with tests and codecov
2. Automation: docker image build, PR and commit builds
3. More measurement plugins
4. More destination plugins
5. Guide for the Backend developer: I would like DC to be simple enough so a web developer can run it, get the data and work on its backend application
6. Guide for the ROS developer: I would like DC to be simple enough so a ROS developer can collect data without the expertise of knowing how to manage databases
7. Handle python destination plugins
8. More use cases showcased in demos

Since I want DC to be community driven, go to our [HelloNext](https://ros2-data-collection.hellonext.co) and vote for your needed features.

It is a feedback tool where everyone can vote and comment on tasks. Note that to avoid re-voting, voting requires to log in, while comments don't.
