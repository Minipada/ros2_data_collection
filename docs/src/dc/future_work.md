# Future work and Roadmap

DC still being in early development, it requires:
1. High test coverage
2. Automation: docker image build, PR and commit builds
3. More measurement plugins
4. More destination plugins
5. Guide for the Backend developer: I would like DC to be simple enough so a web developer can run it, get the data and work on its backend application
6. Guide for the ROS developer: I would like DC to be simple enough so a ROS developer can collect data without the expertise of knowing how to manage databases
7. Handle python destination plugins
8. More use cases showcased in demos
